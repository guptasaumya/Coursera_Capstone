# Applied Data Science Specialisation Capstone - The Battle of Neighbourhoods

Neighbourhoods Segmentation and Clustering.

## Description

In this project, given a city like the City of Toronto, we will segment it into different neighbourhoods using the geographical coordinates of the centre of each neighbourhood. Then, using a combination of location data and machine learning, we will group the neighbourhoods into clusters. 

This project was created as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certification.
