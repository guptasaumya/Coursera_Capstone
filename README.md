# Applied Data Science Specialisation Capstone - Part 1

Toronto City Neighbourhoods Segmentation and Clustering.

## Description

In this project, given a city like the City of Toronto, we will segment it into different neighbourhoods using the geographical coordinates of the centre of each neighbourhood. Then, using a combination of location data and machine learning, we will group the neighbourhoods into clusters. 

This project was created as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certification.

## Getting Started

### Usage
The analysis and the code are presented together in ```toronto_neighbourhoods_segmentation_clustering.ipynb```. The code is in Python; hence, Python and optional tools like Jupyter Notebook are required to run the code. In addition, the images used in the report are present separately for easy access to the information.

However, this repository also stores the data used for analysis in ```Geospatial_Coordinates.csv```.
